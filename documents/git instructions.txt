//if it's in brackets <> that means that you fill it in with what it's describing, not what it actually says.

in order to overwrite local files with a remote branch
* git checkout <branchname>
* git fetch //this downloads the branch you're in without changing any files
* git reset --hard origin/<branchname>

when adding new files
* git status //lists all new or changed or removed files
* git add . //this adds all the new or changed or removed files to the staging area
* git commit -m "describe what you have done in these quotes"
* git push //sends your changes to the remote

When you dun goofed and have conflicts on the remote with your local so you can't push
* git commit -m "message" //make sure to commit what you've done. It won't go away now.
* git merge - <remote that you have conflicts on>
// at this point it will prompt you for a text file commit explaining why you're trash and have to merge.
// use this key sequence to be done when you are done: ESC :qw ENTER
* git push
// now your work is merged with your goof, and there's a nice sorry note that you wrote explaining why you're bad.
